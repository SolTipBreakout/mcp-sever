# Next Steps for Solana MCP HTTP Endpoint Implementation

I've set up TaskMaster-AI for your project and created a detailed breakdown of the tasks needed to implement the Solana MCP HTTP endpoint. Here's how to proceed:

## Project Setup

1. The project has been initialized with TaskMaster-AI in your project root.
2. Tasks have been generated and are available in `/tasks` directory.
3. Each task has its own file with detailed information.

## Working with Tasks

You can use the following TaskMaster-AI commands to manage your tasks:

- View all tasks: `npx taskmaster-ai get-tasks`
- Get details for a specific task: `npx taskmaster-ai get-task <id>`
- Find the next task to work on: `npx taskmaster-ai next-task`
- Update task status: `npx taskmaster-ai set-task-status <id> <status>`

## Implementation Strategy

I recommend tackling the tasks in the following order:

1. **Start with Task 1 (Express Server Framework)**: This sets up the foundation for all other tasks.
2. **Move to Task 2 (MCP Server Integration)**: This connects your existing Solana code to the new HTTP server.
3. **Implement Task 5 (Tool Execution Endpoint)**: This gives you the core functionality to test with.
4. **Add Task 3 (API Key Authentication)**: Security should be implemented early.

The remaining tasks can be implemented as needed based on your priorities.

## Development Environment

Before starting implementation, ensure you have:

1. Node.js and TypeScript installed
2. Access to Solana development environment
3. Environment variables set up (create a `.env` template)
4. Dependencies installed (`express`, `cors`, etc.)

## Technical Recommendations

Based on your existing codebase:

1. Use the `startMcpWithExpress` function in `solana-mcp-server.ts` to integrate with your new Express server
2. Create middleware architecture that allows easy addition of authentication and rate limiting
3. Consider using the Winston logger for structured logging
4. Use a modular approach with separate files for routes, middleware, and controllers

## Testing Approach

1. Set up a test environment with a mock Solana backend
2. Create Postman/Insomnia collection for API testing
3. Implement unit tests for critical components
4. Test with actual blockchain interactions on testnet

## Deployment Considerations

1. Create Docker configuration for containerization
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
3. Consider using environment-specific configurations
4. Plan for monitoring and alerting

By following this structured approach, you'll be able to efficiently implement the Solana MCP HTTP endpoint with all the required features.
